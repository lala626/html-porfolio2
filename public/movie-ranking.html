<h1>The Best Movies According to Lala</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Lilo and Stitch</h3>
<p>This is a very cute movie, about an alien that landed on earth and found a human family in the end. </p>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>This movie explains that love is unconditional, it you are meant to be, God will always make a way. For me this is the best love story movie of all time.</p>
<h3>Serendipity</h3>
<p>A romantic movie that tells people to believe in faith.</p>
